# Weather Station DC powered
This is my weatherstation for long range communication (20-100m) based on the MySensors framework https://www.mysensors.org/

The weather station is connecting 3 different sensors with water protected connections and casing. I've used a Adafruit PermaProto 1/2 sized board which works well here since it's mainly soldering of connectors we need to do and a few resistors.
