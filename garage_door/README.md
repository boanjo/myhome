# Garage Door Opener 
Maybe you have an old motorized garage that you would like to control in a more flexible way? Or maybe you have lost one remote unit or the number of cars are more than the remotes. And after all it sort of defies the purpose of having a garage door opener if you have to leave the car to enter a code on the keylock :)...

Here is a simle solution to pimp your system without having to hack the central control unit for the garage opener (and still be able to use the keypad if you have one of those)

BOM:
* Arduino Mini pro ~$2
* RFM69HW ~$2
* Step up 5v to 12v ~$3
* Box ~$5
* Relay module ~$3

So you should be able to build this for around $15. Then to get this really nice and user friendly i can recommend getting some flic.io buttons. They will cost you at least $20 each but they are sooo worth it. Stick it to the dashboard of your car, next to the door before you leave the house and you can reuse the buttons for other automation tasks too. Works with Low power Bluetooth together with your phone(s) via an app.
