# Rain Gauge Sensor Calibration
This is how you can verify that your rain gauge is working as expected. And if you have a tipping bucket like RainWise 111 or other (semi) professional sensors this is how you can calibrate them.

You will need a bottle (like a PET) that you make a small hole (2.0 mm) in the bottom. It is extremely important that you calibrate the rain gauge at a resonable rate. Typically a one liter bottle should take more than 20 minutes to empty. Otherwise if the "rain" is comming too quickly there will be rain lost in the transitions between each tip. 

Sometimes the flow is already regulated in the funnel of the rain gauge but to control the flow you can do like this: Drill a hole through the lid large enough to insert a tube or hose. You need to be able to control the air flow through the tube. I had a Gardena micro drip system at hand so it was a very natural choice for me and it works great!

Then you need to do some math if you have another sensor (and hope it has't a very complex shape. If it has a complex shape i take it as a sign that the sensor is not very accurate... ever...)

Rainwise 111 is 205mm in diameter so the area is 102,5x102,5x3,14=32989,625mm2

So for every mm of rain it's a volume of 3,3cl

Next you need to determine the volume of your PET bottle. The easiest way to do this is to measure the weight of the bottle. First measure the weight with the empty bottle. Fill up the bottle and be sure to first screw the lid + hose i place so you know how much volume the hose takes. If you fill the bottle completely there will spill over a few centilers when you insert the hose. Now measure the weight. Water weight should match a ml = g

So in my case a full bottle is 103cl. So when the lid is on it's completely full.

So this means that we should get 103/3,3 = 31.22mm of rain from that bottle. And with 0,254mm of rain for every tip (RainWise 111) this sums up to 123 tips of the bucket

If you get an unexpected result you can tune the tipping bucket. You will then have to iterate (repeat the whole procedure of 123 tips). First measure the height of the two screws that the bucket has as stop level. Ideally they should have the same height. If you get too many tips compare to your target then screw them both a bit down. And if you get too few tips elevate the stop by unscrewing them a bit. Measure what you do and take it in small steps (typically mm steps).

Here is a YouTube video showing the setup.
