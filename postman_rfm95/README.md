# Weather Station DC powered
This is my weatherstation for long range communication (20-100m) based on the MySensors framework https://www.mysensors.org/

The weather station is connecting 3 different sensors with water protected connections and casing. I've used a Adafruit PermaProto 1/2 sized board which works well here since it's mainly soldering of connectors we need to do and a few resistors.

The focus for this model is to protect the GX12 connections and the PCB but this with easy access. The box has plenty of room for the homemade 433MHz antenna:  http://www.byvac.com/downloads/RLnn/How-to-make-a-Air-Cooled-433MHz-antenna.pdf.
