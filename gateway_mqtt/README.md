# MQTT Gateway
Here is my favorite model and build intructions for the MQTT gataway using the MySensors framework https://www.mysensors.org/

The casing is done in Fusion 360 and printed in EasyPrint PLA and is very easy to postprocess to your demands. Key here is the cylindric shape which makes sanding easy. Use i file, then 240 paper (dry) and finish wet sanding with 400 & 1200 paper and you will get a very smooth surface.  

Wall mounted:
